# My Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) & [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/). Some may be old, unoptimal or plainly unreadable. I will try to fix them as I learn more.
